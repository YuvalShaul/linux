# Linux Commands

The following are experiments you can run yourself using a Bash terminal on Linux. 

## file and directory commands

- [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) - change directory
- [ls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls) - list file and directories
```
ls -a             # show ALL file, even the invisible ones (that start with a dot)
ls -l             # show more details - long listing
ls <fname>        # list just that file (you can -l to get more info)
ls <dirname>      # list the CONTENT of this directory
ls -d <dirname>   # list the directory name itself
ls -R <dirname>   # list recursively  from <dirname> and downwards
```
- [mkdir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkdir) - make a new directory
- rm - remove file or directories
- pwd - (*p*rint *w*orking *d*irectory) show the current directory
