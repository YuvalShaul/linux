## Extend disk size
In this lab, well:
- Enlarge the "physical disk" (based on a virtual machine)
- Extend a partition to fit the new size
- configure the filesystem inside to fit the new size.

### Extending the disk
- My virtual machine has a ![disk size of 20GB](./material/storage-20G.jpg).  
- I am using the VmWare Workstation Pro setting to resize this to 100GB.
  - The **Expand** button will open a sub window
  - The sub window uses the term **Maximum disk size** which means that this is the physical size, and it is the maximum that partitions can use.
  - ![see example](./material/storage-expand-to-100G.jpg)
