# Environment

## Watch the environment

- Use **env** to see the current shell environment
- 

## Behaviour of a shell variable

- Create a new variable:  
**nyname=\<my name\>**  
(in my case:  myname=yuval)
- Run a new shell:  
**bash**
- View your variable:  
**echo $myname**
- Why can't you see the variable?
- Exit from the new shell, back to the previous shell:  
**exit**
- View your variable again:  
**echo $myname**


## Export a variable to environment

- Export your variable to environment:  
**export myname**
- Run a new shell (again):  
**bash**
- View your variable:  
**echo $myname**
