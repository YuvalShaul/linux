# A tiny shell project

Write your own shell.  

- Your shell should be able to show a prompt.
- you should be able to change the prompt using a myprompt command.  
example:  
**myprompt \<the-new-prompt\>**
- You should remember the last 10 commands, and:
  - show these commands when the user use the **hist** command (without parameters)
  - run a command again if the user uses **hist \<command-number\>**
- Anything you don't know should be considered a command, and run.
- What other features can you think about?
