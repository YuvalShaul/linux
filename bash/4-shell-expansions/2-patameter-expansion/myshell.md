# A tiny shell project

Write your own shell.  

- Your shell should be able to show a prompt.
- you should be able to change the prompt using a myprompt command.  
example:  
**myprompt <the-new-prompt>
- You should support a simgple **cd** command:  
cd <directory-to-go>
- You should remember your current directory, so that cd will be easy to operate.
- Anything you don't know should be considered a command, and run.
- What other features can you think about?
