# A hello world script

- Why not calling your new script "test"?  
(try **type test** to understand)
- Run you script from:
  - the current directory
  - from another directory
- When you're done, add your script directory to PATH, so that you can run it from amywhere:  
**PATH=$PATH:\<directory of script\>**
- If you have to, change file permissions
- Now, open a new window, go to the same directory, and try to run **hello** again.  
Is it working?  
Why?  
- Finally, run hello in these 3 ways, and explain what's going on in each one:
  - **source hello**
  - **./hello**
       or
    **hello**  (if your path allows that)
  - **bash hello**
