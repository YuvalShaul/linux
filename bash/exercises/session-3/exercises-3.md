  - file operations
(add this line for testing)

1. Create a script that accepts a directory path as parameter and counts how many files have a ".txt" extension in that directory and all subdirectories.

2. Write a script that takes multiple file names as parameters and renames them by adding the current date as prefix.

3. Create a function that checks if a number is prime, then use it in a loop to find all prime numbers between two command line parameters.

4. Write a script that accepts a filename and creates numbered backup copies (file.txt.1, file.txt.2, etc.) up to a specified maximum number.

5. Create a script that monitors a directory for new files and moves files older than X minutes to an archive directory.

6. Write a function that converts decimal numbers to binary, then process all numbers provided as command line arguments.

7. Create a script that reads a list of URLs from a file and downloads them while showing progress.

8. Write a script that generates a specified number of random passwords with given length and complexity requirements.

9. Create a function that calculates factorial, then use it to generate a table of factorials from 1 to N (N passed as parameter).

10. Write a script that finds duplicate files in a directory based on content (not just name).

11. Create a script that accepts file extensions as parameters and organizes files in current directory into subdirectories based on extensions.

12. Write a function that validates IP addresses, then check a list of IPs from a file.

13. Create a script that monitors system resources (CPU, memory, disk) and logs when usage exceeds specified thresholds.

14. Write a script that processes a log file and generates a summary of unique IP addresses and their access counts.

15. Create a function that performs basic arithmetic operations, then process mathematical expressions from command line.

16. Write a script that renames files in a directory to follow a consistent naming pattern with padded numbers.

17. Create a script that backs up specified directories, compressing them with date-based naming.

18. Write a function that checks string palindromes, then process words from a file.

19. Create a script that generates a directory tree structure based on a template file.

20. Write a script that manages a simple task list with add, remove, and list operations using command line parameters.
