# Linux Programs

A **"real"** linux program is an executable file of the type ELF.

## Looking at programs
You can learn about programs by finding one in /usr/bin (for example).  
Then inspect it.
Example:
- **ls -l /usr/bin/date**  
(which will show you the program file)
- **file /usr/bin/date**  
(which will inspect the file type)
- **which date**  
(which will make sure that this is what runs when you type **date**)
- **date**  
(to actually run the program)
