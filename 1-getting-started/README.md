# Getting Started

- Before doing anything else, make sure you have a linux installation you can use.
- I usually use an Ubuntu (currently version 22.04) distribution.
- The easiest way is to run Ubuntu on your current Windows or Mac machine using VirtualBox.
- Use [this link](https://github.com/YuvalShaul/linux/blob/main/1-getting-started/infrastructure.md) to install everything.
